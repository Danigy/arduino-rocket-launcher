# arduino-rocket-launcher
This is a project that uses the arduino uno to launch model rockets. Besides electronic components that plug into the breadboard, you will need a 12v power supply with
a battery clip, at least 10 ft leads with alligator clips, a power source for the arduino, and everything you would normally need to 
launch a rocket: engine, igniter, plug, launch pad, etc. I have included code and a diagram of the breadboard to help you, and if you 
decide to build it, tell me how it goes!
